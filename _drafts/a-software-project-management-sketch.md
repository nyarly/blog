title: A software project management sketch

Build around the idea of _evolving requirements_

* "We are going to build X"
* Break out the features of X
* Matrix with quality requirements - a11y, security, o11y, etc
* Associate tasks with feature/quality - "narrow" n-m; i.e. usually 1-1
* Model workflow - build, review, merge, QA, deploy, etc.

Change over time:
* Create new features/qualities
* Retire old features/qualities
* Prioritization of quality within a feature
* Prioritization/valuation of features

Goals: "What is X?" report/guide/README thing.
Association of features to docs - docs first?
Includes what X is now, what the road map is, predictions about roadmap.
