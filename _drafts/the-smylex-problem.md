title: The Smylex Problem
---

In Tim Burton's Batman(1989)
the Joker uses a
terrifying poison called Symlex
to kill many of his victims.
In one plot,
he separates the complex chemical
and introduces its components into hygene products.
The denizens of Gotham die at random,
cackling inappropriately, and leaving rictus-marked corpses.
Only certain combinations of products
result in death.
Batman saves the day
by publishing a list of the combinations,
which allows everyone to
plan a morning regimen that avoids the fatal blends.
As one does.

I'd forgotten this story until recently,
even though for most of my professional life
I've lived a version of it.

a category of hard problems
live at the intersection of 3+ systems.

purveyors of the systems seldom help,
since the issue isn't with their thing.

often the fix is hacky, delicate.

solution?
