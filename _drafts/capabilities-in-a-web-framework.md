title: Capabilities in a Web Framework

What if your API backend managed its model objects as capabilities?

Could that be made easy to use?
For instance, could a non-auth,
or a 3 role system
be written in such a framework without
always engaging in a security ceremony?
But when a complex system,
with many roles,
and many and nuanced objects
needs it, the capabilities are there to be used?
And that even in the most complex case,
developers can work with the system
in blissful oblivion
except in the sections of the code
where capabilities are assigned?
As a third requirement,
the error handling should be seamless:
a security violation should be
as easy to recover from
as an empty DB response.
