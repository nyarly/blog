Like an open source Udemy sorta

Sessions are proposed by users
either because they want to teach
or because it's something they want to know about.
Sessions vs. courses
Courses scaled to topic.
Concepts added to courses,
into curricula.
Shuffle curriculum items around between courses,
in order to build scoped courses.
i.e. I just want an intro vs.
I want to be compentant/conversant.

Teachers volunteer on courses.
Subjects guide where teachers might volunteer.
Teachers might endorse one another -
"oh, she knows this subject better than me"
and set class limits.

System could schedule class sessions,
maybe even handle WebRTC hangouts
(but maybe not much point to that -
prefer using existing services.
