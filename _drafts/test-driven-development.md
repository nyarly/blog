title: Test Driven Design
---

It's not about test first. Or red-green-refactor. Those are good practices. And
they're called test driven *development.*

Test driven *design* has become far more important to me. It's the changes that
happen in a code base in order to make it testable.

Shorter call stacks. Functional programming. Hexagonal architecture.

Isolating external dependencies from the code that work with them.

REST.
