QR code mediated contact info.

QR code links to contact page.
Link is printed below code.
Social network style sharing of contact info.

Users have profiles they maintain themselves.
Users have a primary profile, with all information,
and then expose those contact information to profiles.

Profiles have versions - once shared, you see versions over time.
i.e. you can go back to the first version you saw.

If you have a profile, you can request more contact info,
which the user can easily approve.
