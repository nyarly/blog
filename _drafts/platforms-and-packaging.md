title: Platforms and packaging

Platform:
language and environment.
Operating system.

Languages these days provide package repos
So to OS distributions
Also, sometimes there are "shadow repos"
(think Homebrew,
research Nuget)

These systems are often in tension,
and users and developers are caught in the middle.

Sometimes deploying anything with
the distribution repo
breaks deploying with
the language repo.
