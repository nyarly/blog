title: The DMCA and a Real Professional Organization
---

Right of repair as exceptions to the DMCA.
Specific exemptions, for particular products.
What if: engineers licensed by recognized bodies granted a blanket exemption in the public good.
Unethical uses of the exemption would be grounds for revocation of engineering license.

Businesses, industries created in the gap:
licensed engineers investigating and improving on DCMA protected products.
DMCA becomes less onerous, since there's an avenue to working around it.
Specific situations determined by engineers,
rather than distant lawmakers.

A "circumvention" industry creates a demand for licensed software and systems engineers.
It likewise becomes politically tenable to extend protections on various software categories.
High frequency trading requires a license, or medical device development.

Also note, there's plenty of endeavours still that don't require a license.
Even work within a field: conceivably work need only be overseen or approved by a licensed engineer.
So there's plenty of room for unlicensed engineering.

Also,
We did this to ourselves
Hiring software people is super hard
everyone does ther own thing
at a very small size, companies start using recruiters
most recruiters are boiler rooms
they pump resumes
they do interview prep
and the only tool we know about gets gamed into submission

In medicine, you have to be licensed
In law
As a plumber
There's hiring and recruiting
but no recruiter presents candidates without a license

We don't want a union
or a professional organization
partly because senior people have a whole word-of-mouth thing
(an old boys network)
but it works to our detriment
by reducing our relocation options
by making it hard to hire
increasing the echo chamber

we don't want to discover we're wrong
establishing a licensing board might do that

There are professional organizations.
There are professional standards.

Maybe start using them?
Or start a recruiting shop that grows into a defacto professional org
