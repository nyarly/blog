title: I Have No Metrics...
---

Software doesn't have metrics it can believe in

Lots of metrics, they're all effectively subjective.

Lines of code.
Coverage.
Coupling.
Connascence.
Productivity.

Ops has metrics: latency, throughput, downtime, call time...

Ops people are nicer.

Devs are caught up in semi-religious arguments and posturing.
