title: The Checklist of Non-business Application Requirements
---

A professionally developed software application
should fulfill a standard set of
basic requirements
besides and in addition to
whatever business function it serves.
At least, so it seems.

* Version Control
* Test Coverage
* Application Security
* Accessibility
* Continuous Integration and Deployment
* Observability
* System Distribution
* Data Privacy
* ... there was more

[ and here we get to:
maybe this is two separate posts:
because there's
"now that you know 'hello world,'
here's also this other junk"
and there's
"how could you ship without..."
which are related but...
IOW, two audiences.
But there's also a shared theme.]

Those are each big tasks.
It seems like by the time
"professionally developed"
is accomplished, there'd be no time left for
delivering business value.

I've advocated for each of these
within particular project.
I've bemoaned the lack of expertise about
e.g. cryptography, or metrics
available to certain teams.
But at the same time,
I sometimes stop and wonder
"how do we get anything done?"

Some of this can be ameliorated
by toolkits or frameworks.
But much of it inescapably requires
expert time and labor.

Which is,
I guess,
why we all have jobs.
