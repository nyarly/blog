title: Where Jobs Come From
---
Culturally we mistake why people have jobs.
We believe were given jobs,
as badges of virtue.
That there's a limited supply.

But we have jobs
because there's a demand for our labor.
We're"given" jobs
because of our (bad) process for matching worker to work.

The demand comes from consumption.
The consumption comes from people with money.
Workers.
More workers is more jobs.

But also:
in a family, we all chip in so we get what we need.
Economics, in one sense, is a way of mediating that process globally.
There's something lovely there
