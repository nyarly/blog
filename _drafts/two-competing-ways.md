title: Two Competing Ways
---

Very frustrating when,
there are two approaches to a problem,
each with tradeoffs,
and neither entirely solves things.

TeamCity has
MetaRunners and
Build Templates.

Go uses nulls for "lack of presence"
in JSON.
Java too.

Synchronized methods and Liskov Substitution.
What color is your function?

I contend that
these tensions point to a third way.
Message passing,
instead of mutexes.
Ownership instead of GC/allocation.
Option/Maybe instead of null.
