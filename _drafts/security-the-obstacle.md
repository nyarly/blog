title: Security, the Obstacle
---

No matter how good the security system,
no matter how experiences the engineers,
developers treat security as an obstacle.
Just like
other requirements
developers do as little as possible to accomplish their tasks
while satisfying the constraints of security.
That's how hard coded secrets happen:
it's easier than getting the secret from configs
which is easier than integrating with workload identity.
Plaintext is easier than TLS is easier than a bespoke encrypted protocol.

Developers treat security as an obstacle.

And, as part of this practice,
they'll argue that what they're doing is fine
it's a reasonable tradeoff of time to market.

Also, users will do the same thing,
but have less power to evade security wholesale.

Security takes a lot of knowledge
and reasoning to get right.
Getting it wrong is invisible
until it's too late.
Like radioactive waste -
you can't _see_ how bad it is.
Until your organs fail -
or the kids have extra limbs.

Likewise, the tradeoffs are hard to reason about.
