title: Outsourcing vs. Expertise
---

The "its all tradeoffs" desk
Heroku: no Ops expertise, $$$$$
AWS: no bare iron expertise $$$
Colo: all the expertise $

But: if you've got no Ops, Colo will be $$$$$$$$$$$$
if you've got no Ops, AWS will be $$$$$$$$$
if you've got no bare iron expertise, Colo $$$$$$

you know, roughly.
The expertise costs money (it's staff)
And staff changes their minds about where they want to work,
so there's risk.

Expertise can flow inside a company though,
i.e. staff training each other,
which is good for us as engineers,
and for engineering as a discipline.
