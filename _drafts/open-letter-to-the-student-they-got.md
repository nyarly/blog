title: Open letter to the student they got
---

When I was a consultant,
a lot of clients proposed the idea
of getting "a student"
to start, finish or maintain a project.
These were invariably the least "in touch" clients.
They'd lucked into hiring us,
and while their general business acumen was sometimes excellent,
they left understanding software engineering to us.

These conversations always terrified me.

If you're that student,
or otherwise fresh out of a program,
working freelance on a reasonably large web application,
I have this advice for you:
It's not your fault.
Even moderately sized software projects
are deceptively hard;
worse, it can be very hard even to understand why things are going wrong.
Your employers will assume
that you're at fault.

They didn't know what to hire.
You didn't know you were in over your head.
But they had options.
They decided they'd find someone inexperienced
that they could exploit.
And they found you.

I don't have anything but this advice:
get out now.
Ideally you're reading this before
things have started going south.
Maybe you're just starting to see trouble on the horizon.
Or maybe the server is down constantly,
and the client is calling and emailing
insisting on constant status updates,
and making it clear they hold you responsible.
Get out.

You're tempted by loyalty.
They have none for you.

If you need a sympathetic ear,
reach out.
I don't have a job for you.
I don't want to take over your client.
I can't provide a replacement if you leave.
But I can listen,
and commiserate.
