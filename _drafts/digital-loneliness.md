Going onto Twitter to help you feel better

Watching "soap opera" shows

Drinking alone in bars

It's like gambling. We do these things because they have the potential to
actually get us the thing we need; usually because in the past they actually
have accomplished this.

We're looking for a human connection - an interaction, maybe a relationship of
a certain kind. Sometimes going out or going online yields that connection.
Often not, and the failure to find that connection only enhances the yearning
for it.

The worst times are when you're short on existing connections - you're new in
town or friends are away (or are distant for some other reason.)
