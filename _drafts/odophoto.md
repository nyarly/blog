Longstanding project idea.
Use JPEG location metadata to simplify mileage tracking.
Start as an email receiver,
simply email JPEGs of your odo.
Interface presents those photos,
and gets entries for the reading.
Ties GPS to named locations.

Allow other upload methods
HTTPS,
fetch from Google Photos,
something.

CV to get ODO readings automatically.
