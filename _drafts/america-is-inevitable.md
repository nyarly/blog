title: America Is Inevitable
---
America wins by
cultural hegemony.
We spread McDonalds until there is no opposition,
no them,
only America.

America is a nation of violence,
inequity.

America is an ideal of equality,
opportunity,
freedom.

Book in the last year
need to find reference
suggesting that liberal democracy
contains the seeds of own destruction.
The dark side of
the paradox of acceptance.
In other words,
libdems accept
lots of "them"
who are very socially conservative.
They overwhelm culture,
and surprise you're a caliphate.

(need reference;
Economist, or Marketplace a few weeks before 3/3)
Reality is that immigration
is a tiny fraction of population,
and what we actually find is that
immigrants themselves are happy to be here.
(Who goes, _en masse_ to change what they're doing?)
(Witness how scads of dems aren't moving to Montana.)
First generation folks
are where you find
the most fractious,
feeling like they've "lost" their culture.
Even that is a small percentage.
Second generation,
much more complete assimilation.
