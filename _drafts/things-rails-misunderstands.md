and Rails developers learn them
and are done a disservice

REST is not pretty URLs
How URLs look is insignificant
URL parameters and POST parameters shouldn't mix
The list and its items are different resources
Resources should not be directly represented in the database
The database knows best
  uniqueness
  associations
  selection
Objects and tables are only sometimes identical
