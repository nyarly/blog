title: You Can't Be Good Enough

Reading a lot of Demming
50/50 that you'll be worse than average
in any one trial

Context:
last year I read a bunch of Goldblatt (the Goal)
and Demming (The New Economics, etc).
Both make the point that people basically don't understand statistics
and try to make it clear with examples and weird little games.
One example Demming likes is basically the Lake Woebegone Fallacy:
"your kid did below average on this test, oh no!"
(so did half the class.)

I found Demming
via studying DevOps research
(e.g. Gene Kim and John Wilson)
and it's striking that Demming has been so influential
on the operations side of tech houses.

One explanation for all the layoffs recently (mid-January 2023)
is that C-suites are afraid that, whenever "everyone" is doing something,
if they don't then their failure to do it
will be seen as the cause of whatever is disappointing
in future reports for their company.
And that, in general,
the chances that they'll perform worse than expected is basically 50/50.
And on the one hand,
there's the inclination to do better
- to learn that, yes, this is how statistics work
- and there's ways to manage that that are somewhat counterintuitive.
- But as soon as you get to counterintuitive,
- you're quickly running up against Everyone Else not understanding it.

No matter who you're answerable to,
it's tough to tell them they should evaluate you
based on your preferred criteria.
