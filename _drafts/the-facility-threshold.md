title: The Facility Threshold
---

To acheive facility with a system
you need to spend enough time with it
frequently enough
enough is modulated by the complexity of the system
complexity includes gotchas and nuance
system churn

If you're not going to acheive the theshold,
better not to do it yourself

If it's not worth acheiving the threshold,
don't bother.

XML - takes a little bit,
but you can get down most of it and not worry

Javascript web frameworks
nuance of UX, churn over time

Ops - so many details

There's value, though
to finding fields with a high threshold:
it's a barrier to entry,
and if it's in demand,
it'll be more worth learning
since you'll be in the minority who know it.
