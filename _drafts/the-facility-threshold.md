title: The Facility Threshold
---

To achieve facility with a system
you need to spend enough time with it
frequently enough
enough is modulated by the complexity of the system
complexity includes gotchas and nuance
system churn

Different than not needing to read the manual.

If you're not going to achieve the threshold,
better not to do it yourself

Getting someone else to do it
is a skill, or a system
with its own facility threshold.

If it's not worth achieving the threshold,
don't bother.

Corollary: a truly fire and forget tool
may be actually _worse_
because you'll struggle through setup,
but when you have trouble with it,
you don't have facility to fix it.

There is value in developing facility with things, though.
{what value?}

What value?
Consider how ORMs or web frameworks
conceal the complexities of other systems.
i.e. use ActiveRecord, not SQL.
SQL is arguably more powerful,
but parsing results into objects is tedious.
Fixing problems that will be exhibited
at the underlying level
(i.e. DB issues an index-violation error)
are harder if you understand only
the higher level framework.

This is a special case
of not having the facility with the system.
Conversely, if you do grok the system
fixing problems is much easier.
It's also easier to envision what's possible.
{expand}

regex
Unix
Programming languages
databases/SQL - the cost of not learning/using frameworks

XML - takes a little bit,
but you can get down most of it and not worry

JavaScript web frameworks
nuance of UX, churn over time

Ops - so many details

There's value, though
to finding fields with a high threshold:
it's a barrier to entry,
and if it's in demand,
it'll be more worth learning
since you'll be in the minority who know it.
