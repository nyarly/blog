We believe in iterating
but some decisions lock us onto a path.

For instance: Go.
Learn it in a weekend, write if err != nil for a lifetime.

Errors cache understanding.
Tools that can be trusted to error well keep you from having to be perfect all the time.

Is the a place in between?

Docker is a container everything.
Easy to get started on but now...
