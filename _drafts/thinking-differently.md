Summary: lonely people have different MRI-measured reactions
to videos that un-lonely people.

I sometimes feel lonely,
and specifically that things I'm passionate about
I have trouble finding resonance for.

So maybe I have a different view on things.
And maybe that view would be valuable to other folks -
who might even see something relatable and reach out.
