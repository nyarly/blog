title: Semantic Versioning, in Reverse

Semver lays out what various version changes imply about the the code that is
versioned.

It's often easier to update the version based on the the changes that were made
since last release.

It requires more discipline, but still better is to resist or postpone making
changes to code that will require "more significant" version changes.
