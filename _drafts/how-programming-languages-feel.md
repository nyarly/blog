title: How Programming Languages Feel
---

There's an almost synesthetic feeling I get about different languages
or programming environments.

Javascript is like working with paper mache -
super easy to craft into lightweight structures,
but fragile and delicate.
Fun to work with, but sometimes heartbreakingly frustrating.

Terraform feels like light sheet metal or heavy fur.
You cut big panels, and then cajole them into place,
gathering and bending them by main force
until you can lace the edges together.
The results are ungainly,
but reliable.

Rust feels like a darkened house at night.
You lay out your plan,
and then stub toes and bark shins until you get where you're going.
As you live there longer,
you get where you're going with fewer bruises.
But that all happens in privacy:
there's a whole phase of writing software that you skip -
so when you're done, it works so well.
You get right to the part of figuring out
if you commanded the genie correctly,
rather than just dealing with breakage.
<!-- Eh? not great -->
