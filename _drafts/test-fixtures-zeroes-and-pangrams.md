title: 'Test fixtures: zeroes and pangrams'
---

Larger problem is testing behavior of
complex data models.

Many TDD examples are about the behavior of
well behaved functions
over relatively simple values
(strings, homogenous arrays, etc).

Many valuable systems operate on
complex data structures
(users, shopping carts, products)

Test fixtures
makeMeABeer()

Zero values
(_a la_ Go)

Pangrams
"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog."

Why prefer in a particular test
a zero to a pangram
or vice versa?

Edge cases -
both 0 and special values are edge cases.
