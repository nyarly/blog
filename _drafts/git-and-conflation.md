rebase vs merge
is really
feature vs history

merge folks want to use git's DAG of commits to track change provenance
rebase folks want to use git to annotate the purpose of changes

I propose that this highlights a core conflict about
how VCS works.

Tagging hunks
instead of rewriting history.

PRs are related.
as "big commits"
