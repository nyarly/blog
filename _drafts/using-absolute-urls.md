title: Using Absolute URLs
---

Web applications use URLs, unsurprisingly.
They often need to decide between relative URLs and absolute.
And when absolute, they need to determine which hostname to use.

Hostname from request?
Which name from request?
(Host: vs. X-Forwarded vs. ?)
A canonical, configured one?

On page vs. in email.
SAML/OAUTH vs internal links.
HTML vs SPA
