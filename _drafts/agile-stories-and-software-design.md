Tension:
A story should be a recognizable feature for the client
Well designed software often includes big chunks of work under the surface
All water flows to one river
Responding to quick cycles and user stories presses to small, redundant modules
i.e. reuse implies abstraction
even moderately sized projects entail abstractions more than one layer removed from UI.
Responding directly to user stories imples harm to reuse
And ultimately more absolute labor,
even if products of labor are more immediately obvious.
But,
decide later,
user input is vital
Refactoring to abstraction is an address,
not 100% solution.

The differencer vs. per-client HTTP stuff.
