title: Workshops and Factories
---

Software is like a factory
a continuous process,
like a conveyer line,
where fungible workers do interchangeable work.
It can be tracked and managed
by applying well understood methodologies,
based on things like queuing theory.

Software is like a workshop,
where skilled craftsfolk
produce one of a kind masterworks
through messy collaboration.
It's more of an art than a science,
it'll be done when it's done.
We believe in people over process.

But it's both!
Modern computing technology
has given us this industry
where creative labor
can and must be managed
like an assembly line.

The work product is abstract,
and invisible.
Which makes the queuing harder to follow.

Inspired by a partial read of _The Phoenix Project_
and a talk Sarah Mei gave at SCNA ~2014
