title: Morality, Personal and Cultural

By what standard are you judging?
Why, by my own. What other is there?

LambdaConf decided to keep Moldbug, despite a public philosphy that includes
(so I hear)
an afirmation of slavery based on race.

Are public opinions a valid basis to exclude a speaker from your conference?
Is LambdaConf implicitly endorsing an ethos of slavery and racism by inviting Moldbug to speak?
This has all happened before, and it will all happen again.

We (I) read moral statements (on Twitter) and reflect about how they apply to my own life.
Do I violate the principles implicit in the statements I read from people I respect?

We each of us construct an ethos, a morality.
None of them can be (logically) consistent and universal.
Even when we ascribe to an external code, necessarily we interpret.

Much of the evil in the world comes from the abdegnation of the responsibilty to reason about morality for ourselves.
(Probably you can drop "about morality" from the above... but I digress.)
In other words, not only is the subscription to an outside morality impossibility, it's evil.
Consult, don't abject yourself.

We're none of as island, and that means we necessarily engage with moralities not our own.
Sometimes, we decide that a new acquantances scruples are repugnant, and we reject them.
I certainly interpret the moral codes of people I know personally very generously, and I suspect that's very common.
In other words, we all perform a version of "oh, that's just Chuck being Chuck."
(Those who *never* do that: you have my admiration, but I don't know that I can parse you as a human person.)

But we also do our best to influence each other's morals.
Like the elementary school game where you hit my pencil with your pencil and we see which one breaks.
Some of that is by making the public statements about morality that make me uncertain.
Some of that is by calling out perceived misdeeds in our circles of acquaintance.
Best, perhaps, is by acting as our codes dictate -
standing on public transit for others (and which others...)
apologizing for misdeeds to our bemused friends and colleagues;
standing up for the underprivileged and unpopular.

Somehow, we form social graphs
(I hate to structure it that way, but understand that I really do thing about graphs an awful lot...)
and part of that formation is the recognition of moral action and statements we respect
- that is, that align (or are acceptable, or are aspritations) of our own personal codes -
and the acceptance (or tolerance) of morality we don't agree with.

And somehow, our society
(because, what else is society but the people we socialize with?)
implies certain _systemic_ moral codes - codes that no member of the society hold perfectly themselves
but that are somehow implied by membership in the society.

Social media really does have an impact here.
In moments we can discover new potential members of our society;
and thereby a new social graph, and some marginal impact on our social code.
And in moments, we can each decide to block
("I don't know what they said - I've blocked them, but you haven't")
members of our society.

By implication, we have our own purest moral code,
and we have the social code we accept by implication with our online and meatspace social groups.
And those codes are almost certainly not 100% aligned.

We accept the latter, and yet we hold the former - often in absolute terms.

An important phenomenon:
Folks disagree strenuously, and take action to make it clear.
For instance, speakers withdrawing from LambdaConf in protest.
Others understand this action as a supression of the freedom of e.g.
Moldbug to express his beliefs
or the LamdacConf organizers to select the speakers they want.

But this is a mistake.
People are engaging LambdaConf
(and to a limited, more hopeless degree, Moldbug)
in a dialog about their beliefs.
They've found a principle that cannot be compatible,
and they're calling it out for discussion.

Maybe the result is that social graphs are severed.
_And that's all right._
One way of understanding what's happened is that we've discovered a way in which the "average" moral code is incompitable with our own.
The way to fix that is to change the sample set from which we compute the average.
And the way to do that is to exclude members from the set
- like the LambdaConf people.
