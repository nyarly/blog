Blind men and the elephant aphorism

Kubernetes is like the elephant,
and different ops folks are like the blind men.

On prem? In cloud?

Whole cluster deploy?
Per dev-team?
(more variations)

Different folks don't realize they're talking about different views.
Confusion arises when a "trunks" team reads or talks to
a "tail" or "leg" team.
