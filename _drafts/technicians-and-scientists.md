title: Technicians and Scientists
---

We assume
everyone is like us:
same enviroment,
same skill level,
same interests,
same motivations.

When we voice that assumption,
it's plainly false.

One way:
computing has room for,
needs, even,
distinctions between
two categories of operator:
technicians
and scientists.

Like pilots
and aeronautical engineers.

Maybe it's wrong,
but we think of systems as having a tradeoff
between "power" or "expressiveness"
and "ease of use".

In other words, do I need
four years of formal education,
and a genuine instrinsic fascination
with the sheer *math* of CS
to use your system?

And in no small way,
the maximum utility at any level
is to reduce the amount of effort
a consumer of the system
has to invest.

Aeronautic engineers
should be trying to build planes
that pilots can fly.

Because human lifetimes are finite.
