title: Easy to Change, Meet the Ditch
---

There was a 3 part series on OTM with Corey Doctorow about Enshitification,
which is not a sentence I would have thought would be sensible
I do think (and I know this was just ha ha!, but I mean, lolsob, ykwim?)
Doctorow's take remains kind of mustache twirly, where it's weirdly an emergent
property
I terms of actual (game) system design, an interesting feature here is the ease
and speed of change (which seems like a good thing) leads to bad outcomes (see
also: npmjs.com)
