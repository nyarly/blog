title: Positive Interviewing
---

You start an interview at "no" - or else why bother?
(Both parties start at no!)
You mutually want to get to "yes" - if that's the right answer.
Even moderately smart people are good at guessing what people want to hear.
So you want to get to yes without revealing what the "right" answers are.
You want to hire people who know things.
Better, even, if they know different things than you.
So "answer this quiz" is bad: you can only quiz about things you know.

Quick screening
because there are folks
who shoot for the moon.
Followups to check for real understanding.
Check interviewing resources for your screeners.

Have them explain something,
ideally something you don't know well.

Seek justified opinions about relevant subjects.
Someone else's tool that they love or hate.

Metacognition: how well do they undertand
what they understand?
