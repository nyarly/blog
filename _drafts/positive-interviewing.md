title: Positive Interviewing
---

You start an interview at "no" - or else why bother?
(Both parties start at no!)
You mutually want to get to "yes" - if that's the right answer.
Even moderately smart people are good at guessing what people want to hear.
So you want to get to yes without revealing what the "right" answers are.
You want to hire people who know things.
Better, even, if they know different things than you.
So "answer this quiz" is bad: you can only quiz about things you know.
