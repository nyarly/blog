title: Prefer Go to Bash
---

Bash is a glue langauge
like mortar holding system components together
brutalism: all concrete building

Glue language works when system designed for glue

Bash is ubiquitous.

Stringly typed.
Poor error handling.
Many weak cases - pipelines, sockets

Rule of thumb: 10 lines, 2 conditionals.

Go
is also ubiquitous,
and binaries can be built for direct download
or put in tiny containers.

Runs fast.

Handles errors well,

robust standard library
(including
HTTP,
format serialization,
and crypto)

Good UI (stdlib or packages)
Strong package ecosystem.
