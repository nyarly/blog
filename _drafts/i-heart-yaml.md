title: I heart YAML
---

YAML is an often maligned structured text format.

It is complicated, because it's got a lot of nifty features.

Unfortunately, those features are badly documented, much of the time.

YAML in Ruby.

Anything you can marshal

Extensions.

Defined types

References - cycles.

Map merges.

Errors kind of suck.
