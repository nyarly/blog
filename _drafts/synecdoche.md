title: Synecdoche
---
One of the biggest drivers of division in American culture is synecdoche.
And not "one kind of people knows what 'synecdoche' means"
But: we more and more openly ascribe certain beliefs and behaviors to imagined members of a group, and assume that anyone who says one thing, believes this whole platform of things.
And that synecdoche makes them Them, dig? They're the teeming numbers of your enemies. It's attractive in a lot of ways. But it's also a trap, because They seem insurmountable, all powerful.
Case in point: We say "the same people who decry vaccination cards also want proof of ID to vote." I mean, sure, there's some people who maintain both beliefs, and there's a certain incoherence to that.
But both points are debatable. To be clear, there's a right side to both, but it's dogmatic to claim that there's no argument for the other side. And it is reasonable to point out the inconsistency of holding both views at once.
But when you start to say "everyone who wants voter ID, wants no vax cards," you're also implying "there's a significant segment of my voting co-nationals who are irrationally evil."
And that's just defeatist.
