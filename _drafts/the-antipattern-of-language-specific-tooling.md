title: The Antipattern of Language Specific Tooling
---

A language should change the way you think about programming
The value of polyglot
Convenience of using tools in the working language
The trap of that convenience
The reduced scope of targeting one language
The arrogance of language chauvanism (and Maven)
Language contempt
Mixed language environments (but I have to install another VM...)
Packaging a distribution
Our Parents' Parentheses
