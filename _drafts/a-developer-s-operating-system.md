title: A Developer's Operating System
---
Just finished reading _Soul of a New Machine_

OS is one of those things I think is decidedly a personal preference.
There'll be some environments where they'll dictate your work machine,
but as a developer,
you'll mostly be in a code editor and browsers all the time so is
there a difference?

My personal preference is Linux,
and as a concrete advantage
I'll point out that it means I can run Docker natively -
Macs have to allocate a VM for Docker images to live in,
which is a hassle.
Also that the software we write
generally runs on Linux servers,
so there's the advantage that you're already going to be adapting to the peculiarities of your target OS.
