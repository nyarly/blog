title: Demand and Supply

Reading https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homestead_strike#Background
The US needs steel for its navy
It can make sure that
a) it gets the steel that's available
and
b) long-term increase steel supply
by offering a premium.
Companies positioned to fulfill the demand
convert their capital to do so.
The US gets the steel,
and expands the steel supply.

On the other side of the coin,
companies discover this increased demand
as signalled by the willingness to pay a premium.
Adroit strategists follow that demand.
Entrepeneurs enter those markets
probably to chase the premium
but also perhaps to pick up the demand
bigger players abandon.

There's a kind of moralism
attached to "government contracts."
And corrupting fortunes made on them.
(The Trump built their fortune on
subsidized real estate purchases.)

But there's clear flow
in otherwise murky market forces there.
