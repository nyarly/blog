title: The Low End of the Mythical Man Month

Link: MMM, Fred Brooks.

1 person, project will take 1 month,
so 2 people, it'll take 2 weeks, right?
Obvious.

Depends on the project.

Famously:
1 woman, gestate a baby in 9 months,
so 2 women in 4.5 months, right?

Does Brooks also say:
10 people, project will take 1 month.
So 1 person, it'll take 10 months...
is absurd?

Why?

Context switching.
Projects have parts,
tasks,
specialties.
If a single team member has to do more than one,
they need to switch between them,
and there's time and attention involved
in that switch.

Requirements evolution.
"Delivering" a project involves it satisfying
the requirements of the moment.
If the team is too small to keep up with
requirements as the facts on the ground change,
or as new requirements are discovered,
the project will never overtake requirements.

So, while adding members to a late project
will make it later (Brooks hypothesis),
allowing a project to be understaffed
will lead to its failure.
