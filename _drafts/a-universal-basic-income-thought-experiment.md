title: A Universal Basic Income Thought Experiment
---

What if UBI?
(UBI housing complexes)
Scutwork?
Cleaning toilets, editing books.
Minimum wage?
Felons?
Felons cleaning toilets for subsistence wages.
Or: in our UBI complex, a cot in the boiler room and waste food.
But! That's what capitalism is doing now:
work, or starve,
because we need clean toilets.
