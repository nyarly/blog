title: Rubrics tool

For making decisions.

When deciding between cars,
or cities to live in,
or job applicants.
Useful to develop a rubric.

That is, a list of qualities,
with a range of scores associated,
and a basis for assigning a 7 rather than a 6, say.

When embarking on a decision activity,
it can sometimes be that you only discover rubrics
from the candidates selected among.

You're also unlikely to be the only person to have made this kind of decision
(people move to new cities all the time),
and the wisdom of others might be valuable.

So:
an online rubrics tool.
Start with effectively a specialized spreadsheet:
candidates as rows,
with related information available,
and rubrics as columns.
Allow users to construct and develop their decision matrices,
and guide them to a decision.
"Based on what you said,
this is your top choice.
Here's 2nd and 3rd choice."
Even more meta:
"Do you like another option better than
your top scoring candidate?
Why? Let's develop new rubrics to validate that."

Users can reuse their rubrics
when they have to make similar decisions.
We hire new people somewhat frequently.
We decide where and what to eat all the time.

Users can share their rubrics,
and common catalogs might develop.
Hiring, car buying, moving, changing jobs.
All useful things to evaluate,
and to share our ideas about how we evaluate them.
Different users might weigh those options differently.

Users might further share their determinations
about certain choices.
Car buying, for instance,
or the next big gadget.
You might add items to your matrix,
and see what other users thought.
An average score, versus your own beliefs,
has its own utility.

Users might share rubrics and whole matrices
with specific other users, on teams for instance,
to help evaluate e.g. job candidates.
Or vacation destinations.
In these cases, hiding results until a full reveal might be useful.
Agreeing on weights for rubric columns would be more important though.
(Maybe just "include or don't")
