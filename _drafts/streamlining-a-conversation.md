title: Streamlining a conversation
---
There's a category of software whose _raison d'etre_ is to streamline a particular form of converation.
Basically, if any of your use cases involve more than one user, your project falls into this category,
at least to some degree.

The streamlining should be ruthless -
where possible, there should be one path down which communication proceeds.

The risk is that important forms of the conversation are made impossible.
This has to be balanced against
"why don't we just use email?"
(or Excel.)
