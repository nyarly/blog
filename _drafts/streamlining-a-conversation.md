title: Streamlining a conversation
---
There's a category of software
whose _raison d'etre_
is to streamline a particular form of converation.
Basically, if any of your use cases
involve more than one user,
your project falls into this category,
at least to some degree.

The streamlining should be ruthless -
where possible, there should be one path down which communication proceeds.

The risk is that important forms of the conversation are made impossible.
This has to be balanced against
"why don't we just use email?"
(or Excel.)

Every new project
also has the impedence of
onboarding new users.
Consider carefully the irritation
of a non-user confronted with
their first interaction with your tool
being an unsolicited notification
issued by an existing user.
There's a feeling of being hassled by
and entitled cool kid.
