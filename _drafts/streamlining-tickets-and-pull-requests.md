title: Streamlining Tickets and Pull Requests
---

Between
Slack,
Jira,
git commit comments
and git pull Requests,
developers repeat themselves a lot.

Here's a story
* discuss issue in Slack
* create story in Jira
* prioritize story in backlog
* move story at start of work
* create branch
* ~~cut wood, carry water~~
* write code, make commits
* push code
* create PR, describe work done
* move story to Review
* PR reviewed merged, CI/CD'done
* move story to Released

We repeat these pieces of information
here and here and here
* What to do/was done
* State of the work

There is refinement as we go

Tools used
* go-jira
* Jira automations
* shell autocompletions
* gh

Possible variations
* GH Issues (or other ticketing)
* Agreed workflows wrt workflow and branching
* Shell (zsh vs fish vs...)
