title: Tacos, College, Business Advice
---

What does a taco have in common with a college education?

Demand _decreases_ as price falls (after a certain point.)

Business advice is more intensely like this:
because it's _value_ diminishes with the price.
If it's bought too cheaply,
it'll be valued too lightly,
and have no real impact on the business.
