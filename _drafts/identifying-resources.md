title: Identifying Resources
---

A characteristic of designing RESTful APIs
is Identifying and describing the resources.
After all,
the objects of the REST architectural style
are resources.

Data that is in the same resource
should
be secured the same
and change the same.
That is, the scope of
authorization
and caching
is necessarily a resource.

Tempted to say
"all data with the same authorization rules
and the same variation
is one resource."
