title: 'Project: Running Agenda'
---

Has this ever happened to you:
you have a recurring meeting
that frequently everyone interrupts their day for
but then no one has anything to talk about.
Maybe someone Slacks about
"if no one has anything to talk about,
I'm cancelling,"
but often there's an awkward silence,
and everyone says something like
"well, nice to see you"
and you get back to work.

Here's a tool to fix that:
instead, there's a single place to drop agenda items.
They can be tagged with people or groups.
Their size is part of the record:
"quick question" through "extended discussion."
Once a group of people have an hour's worth of items,
Agendr issues meeting invites to everyone
with the agenda included.

reply with issues -
"badly sized items"
"conflict"

attempt to resolve via chat/email

Scheduling preferences -
try to have "meeting days" for most participants.
