I've been at a loss to describe what I do for an awfully long time. If I leave
out buzzwords, it comes down to "I make computers go" - and sometimes that even
includes in the direction I'd like them to go.

I feel strongly about computing as a craft and a discipline, and live with the
ongoing suspicion that someone out there actually does know what they're doing,
it's just that we're not on the same social graph.
